# ST BlueNRG Library

This repository hosts a mirror of the ST BlueNRG Library as it can be downloaded from ST.

Please follow the official license from ST for using it.

# Use cases
I myself use it to have a base that compiles under linux (upstream seems to be fine now in this regard) and also to track changes between the updates.
